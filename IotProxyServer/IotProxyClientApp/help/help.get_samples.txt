usage:
wliotproxy get_samples <device_id_or_name> <sensor_name> <start_index> <count> [step]
or
wliotproxy get_samples <device_id_or_name> <sensor_name> <session_id> <start_index> <count> [step]

<session_id> is required only for session storages
<start_index> is zero-based indexes. so if there is COUNT samples in storage,
whole data will be available for 0 till COUNT-1 indexes.
[step] - if set, each "step" value is returned (use it for undersampling)
The count of returned values can be less then <count> if there is no enough data in the storage.
Data is returned as messages, started with "data: " and after that '|'-splitted value.
Example of data:
data: 1508091600227|0
data: 1508091600228|10
data: 1508091600229|9999
In this example "1508091600227" numbers are timestamps (milliseconds from 01.01.1970 00:00),
and "0", "10", "9999" numbers are values.
For 2d sensor (for example, {x,y} coordinates), it will be something like that:
data: 1508091600227|1|1
data: 1508091600228|10|12
data: 1508091600229|9999|-12438.11
