usage:
wliotproxy get_samples <device_id_or_name> <sensor_name> <session_id> <start_index> <end_index>

<session_id> is required only for session storages
<start_index> and <end_index> are zero-based indexes. so if there is COUNT samples in storage,
whole data will be available for 0 start index and COUNT-1 end index.
Data is returned as messages, started with "data: " and after that '|'-splitted value.
Example of data:
data: 1508091600227|0
data: 1508091600228|10
data: 1508091600229|9999
In this example "1508091600227" numbers are timestamps (milliseconds from 01.01.1970 00:00),
and "0", "10", "9999" numbers are values.
For 2d sensor (for example, {x,y} coordinates), it will be something like that:
data: 1508091600227|1|1
data: 1508091600228|10|12
data: 1508091600229|9999|-12438.11
