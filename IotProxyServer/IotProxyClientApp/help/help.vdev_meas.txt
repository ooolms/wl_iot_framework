usage:
wliotproxy vdev_meas <dev_id_or_name> <sensor_name> <data>

<data> is sensor data as for real sensor (see documentation)

This command send data sample as generated from virtual device <dev_id_or_name>.
If a storage for this sensor is created, sample will be send to it,
processed by a script and sent to cloud (if binded, see bind_sensor command).
If the sensor has timestamp in value, you can use system command "date +%s000" to generate
a global timestamp in msecs from 01.01.1970.
Example:
wliotproxy vdev_meas test1 sens3 $(date +%s000)\|666
See bash scripting guide for more details.
