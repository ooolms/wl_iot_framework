Usage:
wliotproxy devices_config <sub-command> [parameters]

<sub-command> - one of available commands to view or change devices configuration
[parameters] - depends on sub-command

Sub-command: get_tty_by_port_name|set_tty_by_port_name
Description: get or set tty filters by port name (file name from /dev/ directory) as comma-separated list.
"Set" command reqiures one parameter - filters list, "get" command returns the same list.
Filters are UNIX regexps, so don't forget to escape special symbols when execute command ("*" -> "\*").
Examples:
$ wliotproxy devices_config set_tty_by_port_name ttyACM\*,ttyUSB0,ttyS0
	daemon will automatically catch all ttyACM devices (ttyACM0, ttyACM1, etc.), ttyUSB0 device and ttyS0 device
$ wliotproxy devices_config get_tty_by_port_name
	returns: "ttyACM*,ttyUSB0,ttyS0" if filter was set as in the previous example

Sub-command: get_tty_by_vid_pid|set_tty_by_vid_pid
Description: get or set tty filters by VID/PID pairs as comma-separated list.
Filters are "VID" or "VID:PID" strings, contains VIDs and PIDs of usb devices,
which are "after" tty ports (USB-COM, USB-TTL, etc.). VID and PID are in lower case.
Examples:
$ wliotproxy devices_config set_tty_by_vid_pid 2341,16d0:0753
	daemon will automatically catch all Arduino tty devices (VID - 2341) and
	Digistump DigiSpark devices made by MSC (VID:PID - 16d0:0753).
$ wliotproxy devices_config get_tty_by_vid_pid
	returns: "2341,16d0:0753" if filter was set as in the previous example

Sub-command: get_tcp_by_address|set_tcp_by_address
Description: get or set tcp devices fitlers as comma-separated list of IP addresses or host names.
Examples:
$ wliotproxy devices_config set_tcp_by_address 192.168.1.1,example.com,test.com
	daemon will try to connect to tcp devices with IP address 192.168.1.1 and host names example.com and test.com.
$ wliotproxy devices_config get_tcp_by_address
	returns: "192.168.1.1,example.com,test.com" if filter was set as in the previous example

Sub-command: set_detect_tcp_devices
Description: enable or disable automatic detection of the network tcp devices in the local network
(using UDP broadcast requests). If "true" or "1" set, detection is enabled, if "false" or "0" - disabled.
Examples:
$ wliotproxy devices_config set_detect_tcp_devices 1
	detection enabled
$ wliotproxy devices_config set_detect_tcp_devices false
	detection disabled
