Usage:
wliotproxy add_storage <device_id_or_name> <sensor_name> <storage_type> <timestamp_rule> [--N=n]

<storage_type> - can be one of: continuous, auto_sessions, manual_sessions, last_n_values, memory.
If storage type is last_n_values or memory, --N= parameter specifies stored values count.
"memory" storage type: values don't saved to disk, only 1 last value stored in memory.
May be used to export data to external services.
<timestamp rule> - can be one of: dont_touch, add_global_time, drop_time.

Storage types:
continuous - all values are stored in one large values list, sensors with local timestamps are not allowed
auto_sessions - values are stored in sessions, session starts on the device connection
	and stoped on the device disconnection or service down
manual_sessions - values are stored in sessions, sessions are started and stopped manually by commands
last_n_values - last N values (default - 1 value) are stored, when new value appears, the oldest are removed
memory - last N values are stored in memory

Timestamp rule:
dont_touch - - don't touch timestamp in any case
add_global_time - add global timestamp (msecs from 01.01.1970), value timestamp is ommited
drop_time - drop timestamp and save only value itself
